## The Problem We Solve

Every semester across Indian and global campuses:

- Students **spend thousands** on items they only need for weeks (projectors, books, lab equipment)
- **Lost belongings go unclaimed** because there's no centralized, trusted recovery system
- There is **no verified, college-scoped** platform — generic marketplaces (OLX, Facebook groups) have zero identity verification, no trust systems, and no campus boundaries
- Students who **need specific items** have no way to broadcast that demand to peers who might have them

**Result:** Wasted money, wasted resources, broken trust, and a fragmented campus experience.

## Our Solution

**Campus Connect** transforms every campus into a self-sustaining circular economy. It combines a **three-mode marketplace**, a **verified lost & found system**, a **community wanted board**, and **ML-powered recommendations** — all scoped by college domain and backed by a behavioral trust engine.

Unlike generic platforms, Campus Connect enforces trust at the **infrastructure level**: OTP-verified campus emails, domain-scoped item visibility, behavioral trust scores, and structured transaction lifecycles with dispute resolution.

---

## One Platform, Every Campus — Fully Isolated

Campus Connect is not a single shared marketplace. It is a **multi-tenant platform where every college operates as an independent, isolated ecosystem** — all from a single deployment.

```

```

**How it works:**

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Identity Scoping** | User's `collegeDomain` is extracted from their verified email at registration (e.g., `iiitl.ac.in`, `iitb.ac.in`) |
| **Data Isolation** | All item queries, recommendations, and feeds are filtered by `collegeDomain` — a student at IIIT Lucknow never sees items listed at IIT Bombay |
| **Automatic Onboarding** | New colleges are onboarded the moment a student signs up with a valid `.edu` / `.ac.in` / `.edu.in` domain — no manual setup required |
| **Independent Ecosystems** | Each campus has its own marketplace, lost & found board, wanted board, trust scores, and transaction history |
| **Scalability** | Adding a new campus costs zero infrastructure — the platform scales horizontally by college domain without any code or configuration changes |

**Why this matters:** A student at IIIT Lucknow sees only items, lost posts, and wanted requests from IIIT Lucknow. This keeps the experience hyperlocal, relevant, and trustworthy — exactly how a campus community should work. And yet, the entire system runs on a single deployment, making it operationally simple and cost-effective to scale to hundreds of colleges.

> **100+ Indian college domains supported out of the box** — IIITs, IITs, NITs, and more. New domains are auto-detected or can be added via [GitHub Issues]

## Feature Deep Dive

### 1. ML-Powered Recommendation Engine

Campus Connect's recommendation system goes beyond simple filtering. It implements a **multi-signal scoring model** that learns from user behavior:

```
Score = CategoryAffinity(3) + TrustSignal(1) + ModeRelevance(1) + RecencyBoost(2)
```

| Signal | Weight | How It Works |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Category Affinity** | +3 | Analyzes user's past requests and listings to build a category preference vector |
| **Owner Trust Signal** | +1 | Prioritizes items from high-trust owners (score > 70) |
| **Mode Relevance** | +1 | Boosts rent/sell items (higher engagement intent) |
| **Recency Boost** | +2 | Surfaces items listed within the last 7 days |

Items are scored, ranked, and the top 6 are surfaced as **"Picked for You"** on the browse page — each with a visual "Recommended" badge. Recommended items are deduplicated from the main feed to prevent redundancy.

**Why this matters:** Users see relevant items immediately instead of scrolling through hundreds of listings. This drives engagement and faster transactions.

---

### 2. Three-Mode Marketplace with Instant Claims

Every item listing supports one of three modes:

| Mode | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Rent** | Temporary use with return date | "Borrow my DSLR for the weekend — ₹200/day" |
| **Sell** | Permanent transfer | "Selling my Data Structures textbook — ₹150" |
| **Give** | Free distribution | "Giving away my old hoodie — free to claim" |

**Instant Claim** (for Give mode): Owners can enable a queue-based system where users join a claim queue instantly without owner approval. The system enforces `maxClaimers` limits — once the queue is full, the item shows "Fully Claimed." This eliminates manual review overhead for high-demand free items.

**Counter-Offer System:** Owners can respond to requests with modified terms. Full negotiation history is preserved, creating a transparent bargaining trail.

---

### 3. Lost & Found with Multi-Step Verification

This isn't a simple "post and hope" system. Campus Connect implements a **structured verification pipeline**:

```
Report → Claim Submitted → Verification Questions Sent → Answers Reviewed
  → Claim Verified → Chat Opens → Meetup Coordinated → Resolved
```

- **Verification Questions:** When posting a lost item, the owner sets custom security questions (e.g., "What sticker is on the back?"). Only the real owner would know the answers.
- **Claim Review:** The poster reviews answers before approving. False claims are rejected.
- **Dedicated Chat:** Once verified, a rich chat channel opens with image sharing, GPS location, and meetup proposals.
- **Resolution Tracking:** Posts are marked as resolved, providing campus-wide recovery statistics.

**Why this matters:** On most campuses, lost items are posted in WhatsApp groups with zero verification. Anyone can claim anything. Campus Connect adds accountability.

---

### 4. Community Wanted Board

A reverse-marketplace where **demand creates supply**:

1. Student posts what they need (title, description, budget, urgency level)
2. Other students browse wanted posts and **make offers** (with price, description, photos)
3. The requester reviews competing offers and accepts the best one
4. A private chat channel opens for coordination

**Urgency Levels:** Low → Medium → High → Urgent — visually color-coded so the community can prioritize.

**Why this matters:** Traditional marketplaces only work when supply is already listed. The wanted board captures latent demand and activates supply that wouldn't otherwise be listed.

---

### 5. Event-Driven Real-Time Architecture

Campus Connect uses **Socket.IO** for a fully event-driven real-time layer:

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Private Chat Rooms** | Isolated rooms per transaction, claim, and offer |
| **Typing Indicators** | Real-time `typing` / `stop-typing` events with 1s debounce |
| **Image Uploads** | `FormData` → Backend → Cloudinary → URL returned via socket |
| **GPS Location Sharing** | Browser Geolocation API → coordinates sent → rendered as Google Maps link |
| **Meetup Proposals** | Structured proposals (date/time/location/notes) with Accept/Decline actions |
| **Push Notifications** | Server emits `notification` events for all lifecycle transitions |

All messages are **persisted in MongoDB** — users see full history when they reopen a chat.

---

### 6. Behavioral Trust Score Engine

Trust isn't a static rating — it's a **dynamic, behavior-driven metric** that reflects real transaction outcomes:

| Behavior | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| On-time return | **+5** |
| Successful transaction completion | **+3** |
| Dispute resolved in your favor | **+5** |
| Late return (1–3 days) | **-5** |
| Late return (3+ days) | **-10** |
| Dispute raised against you | **-15** |

- Every user starts at **50 / 100**
- Trust scores are displayed on profiles, item cards, and within the ML recommendation engine (high-trust owners get priority)
- The system creates a **self-regulating community** — bad actors are deprioritized organically

---

### 7. Full Transaction Lifecycle with Dispute Resolution

Every transaction follows a structured, auditable state machine:

```
REQUESTED → ACCEPTED → AGREEMENT_PROPOSED → ACTIVE → RETURN_PENDING → COMPLETED
                                                          ↘ DISPUTED
```

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Agreement Proposal** | Owner sets final price, duration, terms, start date |
| **Dual Confirmation** | Both parties must confirm before transaction goes active |
| **Automated Reminders** | Cron job sends reminders 3 days, 1 day, and day-of return date |
| **Overdue Alerts** | Automatic notifications if return date passes |
| **Dispute Flow** | Either party can raise a dispute with explanation |

**Why this matters:** Unstructured sharing (WhatsApp, word of mouth) has no accountability. Campus Connect's lifecycle creates a paper trail that protects both parties.

---

### 8. College-Scoped OTP Verification

```
Enter Email → Detect College Domain → Send 6-Digit OTP (Resend API) → Verify → Register
```

- Supports **100+ Indian college domains** (IIITs, IITs, NITs, and more)
- Dynamically detects valid `.edu` / `.ac.in` / `.edu.in` patterns
- Items are automatically scoped to the user's `collegeDomain` — students only see items from their own campus
